    		<p>This small tool has been designed in 2003 to offer a simple way to monitor
    			a JBoss Application Server (JBoss AS) instance. It is based, as the application
    			server, on the JMX architecture.</p>
    		<p>As it was laying dormant on the author computer, it has been decided to release
    			it as a free software so that other people may use it and may it make it
    			grow.</p>
